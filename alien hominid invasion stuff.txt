moving and dodging
	you should mostly jump around and dodge alot
	always be dodging to avoid attacks
	try to stay above enemies unless you dont want to
	when under a lot of fire or on fire you should dig to get rid of it
	you should mostly focus on your character and partially on what your
	shooting (unless theres not a lot of bullets on screen)
	dodge ends when you hit something that isnt an enemy
	(flying refers to shooting down to gain height)
	jumping or touching the ground (if you aren't already on it) resets -
the dodge so you can do it again
	also going out of a dig resets it
	you should do jump dodge jump dodge for optimal movement
	you could also do dodge (on the ground) jump dodge jump and then -
the next move you want to do (could be dodge)
shooting
	by being above enemies they cant shoot you (very well)
	always be shooting (unless otherwise)
	also you can use the charged attacks against the flying robot thingies
	also when you're waiting you should charge up ur charge
	long ranged and fast bullets weapons are good against flying enemies
	if your weapon of choice isnt long range you can always fly up with -
shooting down to get to the enemy and either stand on their head or -
throw them (standing on their head for bosses (maybe))
throwing enemies <-(not part of shooting) (its below)
	this doesnt work on big enemies or armored enemies
	you have to jump on their back/head and you can throw them with dodge
	with the moving buttons/stick you can steer the enemy or where you -
want to throw (steering isnt the most controlled (for robots) (unless it's -
the mini mech)
digging
	you can dig for a while before you automatically come out of the -
ground (idk how long it lasts)
	it shows when you leave after a while when the anttenae is glowing
	you can leave ground by pressing jump or dodge button
	you know you dig when the stuff shows when you hold dodge
	this can also get rid of most status effects (or all idk)
	it also saves your charged attack
enemy tips (unfinished)
	when fighting the big guys with shields you can dig to get past them -
(or just jump)
	for flying enemies you can try to shoot them down or you can fly up -
and throw them
	for flying shield enemies you should try to find a platform and then -
use the charged attack
	when fighting bosses you should use charged attacks - it deal more dmg
	when i said flying robot thingies i meant the things that summon -
enemies and look a like a big crate with the hole underneath that has green -
light and is mostly the color black (around that color) (it was armored -
skyvan)
	hunterbots are hard (idk what to do about them)
	most of the flying enemies to can jump on and throw them to instakill
	you can always roll through the bullets
	enemies with some green stuff around them (like translucent) -
probably have a shield around them made by a green bot you have to -
kill the bot to break the shield (it was electrobot)
	most flying enemies you can throw (did i say that already?)

dodge the hands
uhh that one screen where you choose stuff (i forgot what its called)
(the menu at the top) (like setup or something)
	getting triple bullet (dps up) is good for more dmg (or maybe fire -
rate?)
	also dig speed is useful if you like digging (to dodge)
	i like vampire mutation because i can eat the fbi people (and heal)
	i think you should choose to what you like (or good at)
boosts: (gonna do this later)

page 2

etcetera
mutations (the ones ive used)
	bomb thingy (battle block theater reference)
		it can be aimed
		it is a bomb that does dmg
		explodes on contact with enemy or after a while
	vampire (why couldnt you just eat them without mutation)
		has 3 charges
		can be used as long as theres one charge
		you lunge forward when used
		does dmg
		only ends when you touch the floor or when you collide with -
an enemy (or you jump)
		breaks armor (but does not fully kill armored enemies)
		not sure if it works on robots (doesn't work on bosses)
		im pretty sure it heals you (when you eat an enemy)
		it gives you x0.4 health regen
		if you already have health regen it multiplies that by 4/10 -
(gets lower)
		when you're riding an enemy it eats the enemy (when you use -
it) (also when you ride the enemy and use it, it can go im pretty sure it -
can go through armor)
	dispatcher
		summons another alien that does stuff
	deflector
		uno reverse
	show off
		become cool
	weapon specialist
		switch weapon that you chose when you selected the mutation
		gives attack boost when you use the switch
	speed demon
		it makes you run so fast you go up in flames!
weapons (not gonna do that stuff because i need more space) (the spaces)
alien blaster
"Classic blaster for newborn invaders. Limited default range and damage but
high potential"
it shoots

photon gun
"Rapid fire, spread widens at range. Charged shot covers a larger area"
it shoots cooler (and larger charged shot)

energy knife
"ok nevermind im not doing this anymore"
short range and charge dash (i dont like short range) (im gonna try the -
bullet deflection though)

dual laser
pierce and long range (not the best dmg)

combustor
fire attacks that run out (has ammo) (not good dps) (sort of good because -
you can hold it and shoot enemies)

six chambers
i never used this but it said that it does alot of dmg, needs reloading and
charged ricochets

sawed off
lots a dmg for short range and wide, charged shot is cool (i think)

spreadshot
long range and big spread, charge shot fast

human minigun
slow charge but cool when charged (seems to not be good against armor)

bb gun
shoots alot of wide range bees

cryoshot
freezes (slows) enemies but slow fire rate (very slow)

collider
ricochet alot, charged pierces and bounces

human machine gun
slow effect???? high fire rate ig

megashot
i think it does fire dmg and orbeez (kinda slow fire rate)

repeater
i thinks its kinda weird cuz no charged attack and its dmg is confusing

mothership issue
homing small bullet (heat seeking but somehow attack robots) (heat from the -
green energy attack thingies?) (this doesn't really matter though) (just
hypothetical? (is that the right word?))

charged bullet does more dmg (but doesnt home) (also slightly bigger)

acid shot
shoots poison (poison dmg)
has a larger hitbox
not the best dps

lightning gun
homing (for charge)
charge eletrifies
charge like when you walk on the carpet and electrify someone
woah op goes through armor (always go through armor)
homing to powerful (for simple enemies)
good against wasp if: a - you have charge on, b - you know what the wasp does
c - if you stay close for charge to work (thats why range is important)
uhhh only good if your good (at dodging) (for the charge)
also better with range (so you can hit enemies from farther away)
when the enemy opens his mouth to make a sound of getting hurt thats how you -
the stun (or not)
the lightning travels through enemies (if charge is active and you ride enemy)
this is more of a defensive weapon because of its slower fire rate and low -
dmg and becuase of its damage over time and stun
except you can kill alot of enemies with it (mostly the charge)
