    <h1>Alien Setup</h1>
        <p>weapon   mutation</p>
        <p>boost1   boost2</p>
        <p>head     pigment</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Moving and Dodging</h1>
        <p>jump around and dodge a lot</p>
        <p>always dodge to avoid attacks (and for speed/transportation)</p>
        <p>try to stay above enemies unless it's easier to shoot them from the sides or below (under them)</p>
        <p>when having a bad status effect or there's alot of bullets surround you, dig underground to dodge/get rid of status effect</p>
        <p>you should mostly focus on your character and a little bit on what's happening in your peripheral vision (unless there's not a lot of bullets on screen)</p>
        <p>dodge ends when you hit something that isn't an enemy (like the floor or a green plasma bullet thingy (im just gonna call these bullets). i also don't know if wall ends the dodge)</p>
        <p>jumping, touching the ground (if you aren't already on it), or going out of a dig resets your dodge almost instantly</p>
        <p>you can do dodge, jump, dodge, jump and then your next choice of movement (could be dodge) or an attack for optimal movement or if you need to attack from afar</p>
        <p>(flying/fly refers to shooting down to gain height and/or jumping (mostly "and jumping"))</p>
    <h1>Attacking</h1>
        <p>by being above enemies (or below jetpackers) they can't shoot you as well because most of their attacks like to be diagonal or just straight for left and right</p>
        <p>you should always be attacking unless otherwise (like you need to dodge, dig, or something else)</p>
        <p>for some of the flying enemies, you can use a charged attack to deal more damage</p>
        <p>while you're waiting for the next objective (or just waiting in general) you should get a charged attack ready in case a armored enemy comes or just to deal more damage</p>
        <p>fast and long ranged weapons are effective again flying enemies</p>
        <p>if you don't have a long ranged weapon (or you can't seem to hit the enemy) you can always/most of the time fly up to the enemy (probably flying enemies) and throw them</p>
        <p>for energy knife (i haven't really used this weapon) you could maybe just spam the attack button and attack enemies from behind to not get shot and other stuff</p>
        <p>also charged attack (for energy knife) is kinda like an extra jump</p>
        <p>im probably not gonna include energy knife as much (because i'm bad with it and don't know how to use it)</p>
        <p>does dps mean "damage" per second (more damage) or damage "per second" (more fire rate)?</p>
    <h1>Throwing Enemies</h1>
        <p>you can't throw certain enemies or armored enemies</p>
        <p>you have to jump on their head to ride them and then you can either throw them (with dodge button) or you can ride them (and possible shoot enemies while you're at it)</p>
        <p>also most of the robot enemies (not the mini mech after you kick the fbi agent off though) are harder to steer than jetpackers or just normal fbi agents</p>
    <h1>Digging</h1>
        <p>you can dig for a while (or all the time) before you (possibly) come out the ground</p>
        <p>i've noticed that you only really come out of the ground when:</p>
        <p>a: you aren't moving</p>
        <p>b: you are moving but then you accidently slow down a bit and then you get forced out of the ground</p>
        <p>if "b" ever happens, you should always be ready to dodge when the i-frames for getting out of the ground go away</p>
        <p>also it kind of shows when you leave the ground because the anttenae/anttena starts glowing</p>
        <p>i probably mentioned this before but digging gets rid of status effects (it's mostly/only? fire) (i don't know if there's more)</p>
        <p>digging also gets rid of the surpressors (is that what they're called?) (the beeping circles that slow you down)</p>
        <p>i didn't mention this in "moving and dodging" but just dodging (once) gets rid of 1 surpressor</p>
        <p>digging saves your charged attack (if you're still holding the attack button)</p>
        <p>digging is pretty useful if you have dig speed (i don't know why they said it wasn't that useful) (or maybe they didn't)</p>
    <h1>Enemy Tips (unfinished most likely) (somehow i have one enemy locked) (it's probably inchworm)</h1>
        <p>this was said a lot of time but for most flying enemies you can just throw them to insta-kill them</p>
        <p>for flying armored enemies you can either try to find a platform and use the charged attack, shoot them from the floor, or maybe fly up and jump on them and then quickly jump away and use a charged attack</p>
        <p>when fighting bosses you should either use charged attacks or shoot them a lot/use a higher fire rate weapon</p>
        <p>most enemies you can throw</p>
        <p>for alot of enemies with not very high fire rate (<-- the enemies don't have a high fire rate), you can just stay on the floor and spam attacks (not really mutations unless it's the ones that can damage multiple enemies fast)</p>
        <p>i will call the thingies that slow you surpressors or cirlces</p>
        <p>you can damage enemies by throwing them at eachother</p>
    <h2>enemies that are harder but still hard but not hard sometimes tips (these aren't in order most likely) (haven't added all the enemies)</h2>

        <p>shoot it (spam shoot button above) if you don't want to step on very invisible (if you aren't focused on them) landmines (i think that's what they're called) (i'm just gonna call them that)</p>
        <p>throwing it isn't all that fast and they aren't hard to kill</p>
        <p>------</p>
        <p>beambot</p>
        <p>you can either:</p>
        <p>a: fly up and throw it (easier to jump off a platform and throw it) (or you can tank through) (<-- not really advised on insane)</p>
        <p>b: shoot it (from below or the sides)</p>
        <p>-------</p>
        <p>electrobot</p>

        <p>minimech</p>

        <p>--------</p>
        <p>shieldtrooper</p>
        <p>you can either dig underneath or jump above to get past the shield</p>
        <p>both work but digging might be better if he attacks</p>
        <p>when you shoot him he won't turn to face towards you</p>

        <p>this guy if very important to kill</p>
        <p>------------------</p>
        <p>sniper</p>
        <p>this guy is also important to kill (because he's annoying)</p>
        <p>he runs away when you get close</p>
        <p>he shoots 2 bullets:</p>
        <p>one from the laser pointer</p>
        <p>and another sort of slow moving one after that</p>
        <p>------</p>
        <p>jetpacker elite</p>
        <p>you can throw this guy</p>
        <p>-------------</p>
        <p>armored skyvan</p>
        <p>shoot it from below or the sides</p>
        <p>shooting from the top kinda makes you fly away</p>

        <p>inchworm</p>

        <p>airmine</p>
        <p>you can explode them all by going near them so they won't be a problem</p>
        <p>they work as a platform (that expldes after a small amount of time)</p>
        <p>-------</p>
        <p>helicopter</p>
        <p>shoot it with charged attacks or not</p>
        <p>at one point it will start dropping bombs (or always i don't know)</p>
        <p>when this happens, you want to be sort of in front of it to not get hit</p>
        <p>very important to kill because it is most likely an objective</p>
        <p>----------</p>
        <p>spiderbot</p>
        <p>use math to see where you will fall after dodging to catch it</p>

        <p>------</p>
        <p>megabot</p>
        <p>stand on her head and shoot or find a high platform and shoot (you can use mutation)</p>
        <p>-------</p>
        <p>installball_b</p>
        <p>stay close to shoot but not too close before you get slapped</p>
        <p>important to not stay too close or you will get whacked away or not have enough time to dodge the next attack</p>
        <p>dig to dodge most of the attacks</p>
        <p>-------------</p>
        <p>bustletron 2.0</p>
        <p>stay close (but not too close)</p>
        <p>dig to dodge the long ranged attack and the spinning arms attack</p>
        <p>try to have a sort of long ranged weapon to shoot because most of the time he does the firing attack (and he goes up) and he's invincible (i think) when he spins his arms</p>
        <p>also avoid his wheel because it stuns you, does dmg, and i think you can't dodge through it (you can dig through it but that doesn't really matter because he just goes farther away)</p>
        <p>--------------</p>
        <p>W.A.S.P (i forgot rest of the name)</p>
        <p>these aren't actually phases just attack patterns</p>
        <p>this boss is very hard</p>
        <p>invincible bee phase (oh wait nevermind these are miniwasps) (not bees)</p> 
        <p>when the invincible bee thingies come, you can walk left and right to dodge the 2 and 4 patterns</p>
        <p>for the pattern like a wave you should dig and get out at a place where the bee is going up and then go back into the ground</p>
        <p>only dodge if you are sure that you won't crash into a bee</p>
        <p>if you crash into a bee it might combo you into another bee and then you might die</p>
        <p>end of bee phase stuff</p>
        <p>stabby stinger into the ground phase</p>
        <p>you can dodge or dig to not get hit</p>
        <p>this is one of the best phases to get damage into the wasp</p>
        <p>don't stay at the same height as it because there's a chance it might hit you down when it comes back up and then you die</p>
        <p>end of stinger phase</p>
        <p>shooty and surpressor phase</p>
        <p>it's important to kill the enemies that come</p>
        <p>you can get damage here but it's harder</p>
        <p>be ready for the green bullets if you are trying to get dmg in this phase</p>
        <p>make sure to get the circles off so then you can dodge the green bullets</p>
        <p>don't get hit by the green bullets because they do a lot of damage</p>
        <p>hope a lot of enemies don't spawn so you don't get spammed by bullets</p>
        <p>sometimes it might ram forward on your like the other phase so you also want to watch out for that</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYP4WTF8c_Y">very important video</a>
        <p>thats all the information i have for the wasp</p>
        <p>-----------------------------------</p>
        <p>spikebot</p>
        <p>shooting it is easier because it's weak but you can always jump, dodge, or dig to get past it</p>
        <p>--------</p>
        <p>juiceman</p>
        <p>simple boss just shoot him</p>
        <p>don't shoot when he holds his arms together like blocking</p>
        <p>dig to dodge most of his attacks</p>
        <p>--------</p>
        <p>grand mothership (is that a pun on grandmother?)</p>
        <p>sort of hard boss</p>
        <p>in the first phase;</p>
        <p>dodge the triangles</p>
        <p>don't be under the spots that look like they are going to rip open (a drill is going to pop out)</p>
        <p>shoot the arms and dish pointy thingy</p>
        <p>you can dig to dodge the fbi agent bombs</p>
        <p>for the next phase;</p>
        <p>jump on the platforms to hit the mothership</p>
        <p>don't go into the beams when they turn red</p>
        <p>dodge the triangles</p>
        <p>dig to dodge the slamming attack</p>
        <p>in the nexter phase;</p>
        <p>time your jumps to dodge the hands</p>
        <p>try to dodge the triangles</p>
        <p>keep shooting</p>
        <p>beat the boss</p>
        <p>-----------------</p>
        <p>cybernid</p>
        <p>attack it if you want to</p>
        <p>they shoot triangles</p>

        <p>b: makes your current health regen 4/10 of its normal value (say it's 100 then it's 40)</p>
        <p>insta-kills most enemies (doesn't work on bosses or bots)</p>

        <p>--------<p>
        <p>mothership issue</p>
        <p>homing small bullets</p>
        <p>charged attack does more damage but doesn't home</p>
        <p>----------------</p>
        <p>acid shot</p>
        <p>does poison damage</p>
        <p>has a large hitbox</p>

        <p>lightning gun</p>
        <p>homing (for charge) (charge homes)</p>
        <p>charge eletrifies</p>
        <p>charge like when you walk on the carpet and electrify someone</p>
        <p>enemies get that electricity effect if you also shoot them enough times</p>
        <p>goes through armor (not sure if you need charge to go through armor)</p>
        <p>range for this weapon is important</p>
        <p>this stuns</p>
        <p>the lightning travels through enemies (if charge is active and you ride enemy)</p>
